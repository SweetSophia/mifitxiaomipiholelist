MiFit/Xiaomi PiHole Bock List

Block List for PiHole to block the countless connections made by the MiFit App to Chinese webservices like amap, weibo, qq, etc


Note: I won't add Xiaomi/Huami connections to the list (like api-mifit-de.huami.com ), as Xiaomi apps won't be able function properly then. This list is for unwanted connections to third-party Chinese services

Examples:
amap
umeng
qq
weibo
etc.

Copy this into your Blocklist:
